# Stock-price-Prediction

This is a python program for stock price prediction of Advani Enterprises using Machine Learning.
It predict the price of stock using LSTM Model.

LSTM: Long-Short Term Memory based on Recurrent Neural Network(RNN).This recurring module(s) of 'tanh' layers in RNNs allow them to retain information. However,not for a long time, which is why we need LSTM Model.

The picture above depicts four neural network layers in yellow boxes, point wise operators in green circles, input in yellow circles and cell state in blue circles. An LSTM module has a cell state and three gates which provides them with the power to selectively learn, unlearn or retain information from each of the units.
